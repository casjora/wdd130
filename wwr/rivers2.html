                            living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in 
                            love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                        </p>
                        <p> Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the
                             longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water 
                             is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer 
                             in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children 
                             who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.
