      <p>
        In the Home page users will find my goal statement for the site
        where they can see the type of products we support in a grid showing images of those products.
        There will be another grid container with images and information on the services I provide. The banner 
        should contain an image that displays computers or someone fixing a PC. 
        Some of the products we will mention are laptops, personal computers, printers, speakers, web cams, mouse, keyboards, etc.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        This page will contain frequently asked questions where the users should be able to respond questions that might help them decide if my services are needed.
        Some example questions are:
      </p>
      <li>When should I update my computer?</li>
      <p> The computer's software should be updated in a regular basis
      </p>
      <li>How can I tell if my computer is old?</li>
      <p>Does your computer take ages to boot up? Do horizontal lines appear across the screen at random times? When you try to name, rename, or move files, do you get frequent error messages? If so, those are signs your hard drive is beginning to wear out.
      </p>
      <li>How can I tell if my computer will meet my needs?</li>
      <p>
        Each of your computer's components is evaluated to see how well it meets the minimum and recommended requirements for specific products. Usually these requirements can be found in the website information for each product.
      </p>
      <li>Which is superior, a laptop or a PC?</li>
      <p>
        When it comes down to choosing between a desktop and laptop, if you don't need portability, are on a budget and want the ability to upgrade later, a desktop PC is the better choice. Particularly if you're a gamer or professional in need of a powerful PC, you can't go wrong with a desktop computer.
      </p>
      <li>Can you help me fix my computer?</li>
      <p>
        Some really have no idea where to even begin with fixing computer problems. Many of my customers are business owners. They use their computers to do work.
      </p>
      <li>Can I bring my computer to you?</li>
      <p>You absolutely and certainly can!!!</p>
      <li>How do I optimize Windows for my outdated computer?</li>
      <p>
        Update your computer. Updating your computer will usually help it run faster. ...
Shut down and/or restart your computer regularly. ...
Upgrade your RAM. ...
Uninstall unnecessary programs. ...
Delete temporary files. ...
Delete big files you don't need. ...
Close out your tabs. ...
Disable auto-launching programs.
      </p>
      <li>How to install the most recent version of windows?</li>
      <p>
        To check for updates, select Start > Settings > Windows Update , then select Check for updates. If updates are available, you can choose to install them.
      </p>
      <li>How can I check the specs on my computer?</li>
      <p>
        To check your PC hardware specs, click on the Windows Start button, then click on Settings (the gear icon). In the Settings menu, click on System. Scroll down and click on About. On this screen, you should see specs for your processor, Memory (RAM), and other system info, including Windows version
      </p>
      <li>How do I update my computer drivers?</li>
      <p>
        Driver updates for Windows, along with many devices, such as network adapters, monitors, printers, and video cards, are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update. You probably already have the most recent drivers, but if you'd like to manually update or reinstall a driver, here's how:
        In the search box on the taskbar, enter device manager, then select Device Manager.

Select a category to see names of devices, then right-click (or press and hold) the one youâ€™d like to update.

Select Search automatically for updated driver software.

Select Update Driver.

If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the questions are reviewed they should be able to make educated decisions and they will understand the work behind it and also see my prices as fair prices.
